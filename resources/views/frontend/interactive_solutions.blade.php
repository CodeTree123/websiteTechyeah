                        <p class="fs-6">Audio is a powerful interactive tool in any location, particularly when combined with video, sensors and other technologies. Traditional applications like PA systems and overhead music are still essential, but in addition, audio can be combined with public view monitors to deliver greetings and personalized messages as customers enter your location. Deliver entertainment or information to customers who are perusing merchandise or waiting in fast food queues for an extended period of time.</p>

                        <p class="fs-6"> Customer expectations now rest on the ability to access relevant, personalized information that is easily consumable and entertaining. Rather than searching the store for dress accessories, serve up an interactive app on a mobile device that recommends accessories based on the customer's preferences and style. Use interactive technologies to deliver feature menu items based on allergy information or diner preferences. Leverage self-serve kiosks to allow customers to learn about services of interest and present live visual comparison of options.</p>
